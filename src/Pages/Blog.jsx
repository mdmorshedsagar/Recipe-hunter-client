</h2>
    <p className='text-lg'>Controlled components are typically used in situations where the state of a user interface element needs to be managed and updated by a higher-level component. In this approach, the components state is kept in sync with the parent component by passing props and callbacks. This means that the higher-level component has full control over the behavior and appearance of the child component.In contrast, uncontrolled components allow the component to manage its own state without intervention from the parent component. The state is usually stored internally using local state or refs. This approach is often used for simple form inputs where the state of the input does not need to be managed by a higher-level component.</p>

</h2>
    <p className='text-lg'>Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript that provides a platform for building a wide range of applications, while Express.js is a web application framework built on top of Node.js that provides a set of tools and features for building web applications. While you can use Node.js to build a web application from scratch, using Express.js can simplify the process by providing a pre-built framework for handling common web development tasks.</p>
